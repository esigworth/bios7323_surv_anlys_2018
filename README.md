# Applied Survival Analysis
Labs and other materials for Vanderbilt University BIOS 7323 - Applied Survival Analysis (Fall 2018)

To download files for a specific lab click on the lab folder, then the individual file, and then use the 'Raw' button to get code/data from that file.

Alternatively, you can clone the repo and run 'git pull' to get all the updates. Jenny Bryan's http://happygitwithr.com is a good resource to get started with git & github.
